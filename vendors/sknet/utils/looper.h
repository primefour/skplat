 * ALooper
 *
 * A looper is the state tracking an event loop for a thread.
 * Loopers do not define event structures or other such things; rather
 * they are a lower-level facility to attach one or more discrete objects
 * listening for an event.  An "event" here is simply data available on
 * a file descriptor: each attached object has an associated file descriptor,
 * and waiting for "events" means (internally) polling on all of these file
 * descriptors until one or more of them have data available.
 *
 * A thread can have only one ALooper associated with it.
